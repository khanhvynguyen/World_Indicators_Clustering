The objective of this project is to implement different clustering methods to synthetic and real-world data and validate using external and internal validation techniques

**Sythetic Dataset**
- Applied clustering methods (K-means and hierarchical clustering) to generate clustering from 8 datasets ("Data1.csv" to "Data8.csv")
- I evaluated the performacne of the clustering algorithm using external validation. 
- Plot (2D or 3D) the data points for each dataset and color them according to the original class
- Plot (2D or 3D) the data points for each dataset and color them according to the class allocated by the clustering algorithm
